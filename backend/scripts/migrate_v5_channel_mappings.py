"""Migrate v5 `channel_mappings.PHONE_TO_EMAIL` to v6 `channel_identities`.

v5 stored a hand-curated module-level dict mapping phone numbers to user
email addresses, used by both the WhatsApp adapter (direct lookup) and
the Telegram adapter (after contact-sharing). v6 normalises this into
the `channel_identities` Firestore collection that the
`IdentityResolver` consults.

This is a one-shot port. After the WhatsApp + Telegram adapters are
live in production, new mappings get auto-created on first inbound via
`BaseChannel.on_unknown_user`. This script only seeds the historical
data that pre-dates v6.

Usage:
    # Dry run — prints the plan, makes no writes.
    uv run python scripts/migrate_v5_channel_mappings.py --dry-run

    # Live run.
    uv run python scripts/migrate_v5_channel_mappings.py

    # Point at a custom v5 checkout / file path.
    uv run python scripts/migrate_v5_channel_mappings.py \\
        --source /path/to/channel_mappings.py

The mapping `PHONE_TO_EMAIL` is loaded by AST parsing the source file
(not by `import`), so the v5 file's Sunholo dependencies don't have to
be resolvable in the v6 venv. The file is small (24 lines, one dict
literal) and the parse is robust.

Idempotency: every write targets a deterministic doc id
(`whatsapp_{phone}` / `telegram_{phone}`). Existing documents are
skipped (logged as `[skip] already exists`), so re-running is safe.
