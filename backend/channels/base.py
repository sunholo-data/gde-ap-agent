"""Channel framework — `BaseChannel` ABC + Pydantic message models.

Every messaging-channel adapter subclasses `BaseChannel` and implements
three abstract methods (`verify_webhook`, `parse_inbound`, `send`). The
framework provides the shared plumbing: identity resolution, command
parsing, attachment handling, skill dispatch, audit-log metadata.

The flow inside `handle_webhook`:

    verify_webhook  →  parse_inbound  →  IdentityResolver  →
    CommandParser   →  select_skill   →  AttachmentPipeline →
    process_skill_request → send

A new adapter is ~80-120 LOC because identity / commands / attachments /
webhook plumbing are all inherited. See `docs/design/v6.1.0/channels.md`
for the design and `docs/integrations/channels-adapter-howto.md` (M5)
for a walkthrough.
