"""Tests locking in session state scope contracts and _handle_large_output behaviour.

Covers:
  1. _handle_large_output: large content (> 50K chars) → artifact offload
  2. _handle_large_output: small content (≤ 50K chars) → pass-through
  3. user: prefix → persists across sessions for the same user in InMemorySessionService
  4. temp: prefix → NOT persisted; stripped at state-delta extraction time
  5. app: prefix → persists across all sessions in InMemorySessionService

Key InMemorySessionService internals (from ADK source):
  - _session_util.extract_state_delta splits a flat state dict into three buckets:
      {"app": ..., "user": ..., "session": ...}
    temp:-prefixed keys are deliberately excluded from all three buckets, so they
    are never written to self.app_state or self.user_state.  This means:
      * temp: state written during session creation is silently dropped.
      * temp: state written by append_event is dropped at storage commit time.
    In production (VertexAiSessionService) the same contract holds: temp: keys
    survive the current invocation only and are never persisted to the backend.
