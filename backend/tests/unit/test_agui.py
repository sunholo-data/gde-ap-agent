"""Unit tests for protocols.agui.mount_skill_endpoint.

Verifies that the AG-UI mount helper wires an ADK agent into a FastAPI
app at the expected path and with the expected service wiring (the real
session/memory/artifact backends from adk.session, NOT ag_ui_adk's
silent InMemory defaults). Does NOT exercise the live agent loop —
that's covered by tests/api_tests/test_stream_skill.py.

    Without an explicit ``user_id`` (the current ``build_agui_adk_agent``

    owner_uid → Vertex rejects with the documented ValueError → 500.
