"""A2A `message/send` invocation surface — mounted at /a2a.

Pairs with `protocols.a2a` (discovery card). This module mounts ADK's
`to_a2a()` Starlette adapter on the FastAPI app so peer agents can POST
strict A2A v0.2 JSON-RPC (`message/send`, `tasks/get`,
`message/sendSubscribe`) and have it execute through our existing
ADK agent + the same backing services (artifact / session / memory).

Why bridge instead of write our own:
  ADK ships `google.adk.a2a.utils.agent_to_a2a.to_a2a` which returns a
  full Starlette A2A server using the `a2a-sdk` `A2AStarletteApplication`
  internally. We get `message/send`, `message/sendSubscribe`,
  `tasks/get`, `tasks/cancel`, and push-notification config RPCs for free
  by passing it our `BaseAgent` + a pre-built `Runner` + the `AgentCard`
  we already author by hand in `protocols.a2a._build_card_model`.

Why we pass our own card:
  ADK's `AgentCardBuilder` would auto-derive a card from the agent's
  metadata and lose our 7 extension descriptors (a2ui-*, mcp-apps-v1,
  adk-workflow-v1), our `protocolVersion: "0.2.0"`, and our hand-tuned
  skill descriptions. Passing `agent_card=` keeps the discovery card
  (served at `/.well-known/agent.json`) and the mounted A2A card
  (served at `/a2a/.well-known/agent.json` by ADK) byte-identical —
  Discovery Engine / Gemini Enterprise see one card, not two.

Why one runner:
  `to_a2a(runner=...)` accepts a pre-built Runner. We construct it
  from the same `get_session_service` / `get_memory_service` /
  `get_artifact_service` singletons the AG-UI surface
  (`adk.agui.build_agui_adk_agent`) uses, so A2A invocations and AG-UI
  invocations share the same session storage on Vertex Agent Engine
  (when `AGENT_ENGINE_ID` is set). OpenTelemetry traces, BigQuery
  logging, and chat history are uniform across the two surfaces.

Stability note: `to_a2a` is decorated `@a2a_experimental` in
google-adk. Pin the dep version and re-verify on minor bumps.
