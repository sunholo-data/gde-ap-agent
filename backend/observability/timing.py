"""TTFT instrumentation — `LatencyTracker` with kill switch.

Captures per-stage timings for one chat turn and exposes them three ways:
  1. **OTel span attributes** (``aitana.ttft.*``) — survives in Cloud Trace.
  2. **Structured log line** (``event="ttft"``) — one line per request, lands
     in Cloud Logging as ``jsonPayload``; trivial to query in BigQuery.
  3. **AG-UI ``STAGE_PROGRESS`` Custom events** — user-facing labels
     ("Reading documents…", "Thinking…") interleaved into the SSE stream so
     the chat UI can decouple perceived TTFT from real TTFT.

The whole module is gated by ``AITANA_TTFT_MODE``:
  * ``full``   — all three outputs (default)
  * ``log``    — structured log only; no span attributes, no STAGE_PROGRESS
  * ``off``    — no-op; ``mark()`` returns immediately after a single bool check

The off mode exists specifically to A/B-test whether the instrumentation
itself adds latency. Empirically verifying overhead is the M5 deliverable
of the TTFT-INSTR sprint.

The tracker is reached from async callbacks via a ``contextvars.ContextVar``
rather than being passed through ADK session state — ADK state must be
JSON-serializable, and a Python object reference is not. ContextVars are
propagated automatically across ``await`` boundaries within the same task
tree, which is exactly the lifetime of one chat turn.
