# ADR-013 — MCP Apps iframe Sandbox Profile

**Date:** 2026-01-26  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Mark (Aitana Labs)

## Context

MCP Apps are rendered as sandboxed iframes. The sandbox attribute controls the iframe's
security capabilities. Two profiles are relevant:

| Profile | `sandbox` attribute | Origin behavior |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Scripts-only** | `allow-scripts` | Opaque origin (`"null"`) on iframe side |
| **Scripts + same-origin** | `allow-scripts allow-same-origin` | Real origin; iframe can read host cookies |

## Decision

MCP App iframes use `allow-scripts allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-popups`.

The `allow-same-origin` flag is required for:
- The iframe to perform cross-frame postMessage origin checks correctly
- The MCP sandbox-proxy pattern (`ui/initialize` + JSON-RPC bridge)
- Authenticated reads within the iframe's own same-origin context

The MCP sandbox service (`_MCP_SANDBOX_URL`) runs on a **separate origin** from the
platform frontend. This means `allow-same-origin` does NOT grant the iframe access to
the host page's cookies or localStorage — the iframe and host are on different origins.
The flag only allows the iframe to treat itself as same-origin with respect to the
sandbox service's origin.

## Consequences

**Benefits:**
- Enables the full MCP Apps spec (sandbox-proxy pattern, JSON-RPC bridge)
- Enables `AppRenderer` from `@mcp-ui/client` to function correctly
- Enables `event.origin` checking in postMessage handlers

**Risks:**
- If the sandbox service and the platform frontend are accidentally hosted on the same
  origin, `allow-same-origin` would give the iframe access to host cookies. This must
  never happen — always deploy the sandbox on a distinct origin.

## Opaque-origin sub-case: raw iframes without `allow-same-origin`

> **Added 2026-05-21 (template-mcp-apps-artefacts sprint item #28)**

When building a non-agent-summoned iframe (e.g. a student-facing artefact that mounts on
button click, not via a tool call), it may be tempting to use `allow-scripts` alone to
avoid the `allow-same-origin` risks. However:

1. `allow-scripts` without `allow-same-origin` produces an **opaque origin** on the
   iframe's side — all `postMessage` events arrive at the host with `event.origin === "null"`.

2. Checking `event.origin !== "null"` (or against any real origin) will silently reject
   ALL messages from the iframe. This is the most common cause of "my iframe sends
   nothing" bugs.

3. Checking `event.origin === "null"` is dangerously permissive — any cross-origin frame
   can set its origin to `"null"` via `sandbox` attribute.

**The only secure authentication for the `allow-scripts` profile is window-object identity:**

```typescript
// Safe — cannot be spoofed by another browsing context
if (event.source !== iframeRef.current?.contentWindow) return;
```

Use `useSandboxedIframeMessages` from `frontend/src/hooks/useSandboxedIframeMessages.ts`
which encapsulates this pattern.

If you need origin-based auth, you must add `allow-same-origin` to the sandbox attribute
AND ensure the sandbox service is on a distinct origin from the platform (see main
decision above).

## Alternatives Considered

**`sandbox=""` (maximum restriction):** Prevents all script execution — not viable for
interactive MCP Apps.

**No sandbox attribute:** Iframes inherit the full parent document context — unacceptable
security posture for user-supplied or external content.
